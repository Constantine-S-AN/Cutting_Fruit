Webcam Fruit Slicer - Special Edition 🍎🍌💣

A browser-based Augmented Reality (AR) game where you use your hands to slice flying fruits! Built with MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking, this game supports dual-player competition on a single screen.

🎮 Game Features

Motion Control: Uses your computer's webcam to track your index fingers as virtual blades.

Multiplayer (P1 vs P2):

Player 1 (Purple Blade): Tracks your left hand.

Player 2 (Blue Blade): Tracks your right hand.

Dynamic Scoring: Smaller, faster fruits are worth more points than large, slow ones.

Special Fruits:

🍍 Frenzy Pineapple: Triggers "Frenzy Mode" – super fast spawn rate and NO bombs for 3 seconds.

🫐 Freeze Blueberry: Slows down time (gravity and speed) by 80% for 5 seconds.

Hazards:

💣 Bomb: Avoid cutting the glowing red bombs! Hitting one deducts 50 points and causes a screen-shaking explosion.

Visuals: Realistic fruit textures, particle explosions, and dynamic lighting effects.

Bilingual Support: Switch between English and Chinese (中文) via the top-right button.

🕹️ How to Play

Launch: Open the .html file in a modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox recommended).

Permissions: Allow the browser to access your webcam when prompted.

Positioning: Stand back slightly so the camera can see both of your hands clearly.

Slice: Move your index fingers across the screen to slice fruits.

Player 1 uses the Left Hand.

Player 2 uses the Right Hand.

Objective: Score as many points as possible within 60 seconds.

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 Canvas: For high-performance 2D rendering of fruits, particles, and UI.

MediaPipe Hands (Google): For machine-learning-based hand tracking directly in the browser.

JavaScript (ES6+): Core game logic, physics engine (gravity simulation), and state management.

CSS3: UI styling and layout.

📝 Notes

Lighting: Ensure you are in a well-lit room for the best hand-tracking performance.

Performance: The game automatically handles asset loading. If an image fails to load (e.g., due to network issues), the game will fallback to procedural drawing so you can still play.

Enjoy slicing! 🍉
